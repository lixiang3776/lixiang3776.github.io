<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Welcome to my homepage! I am now a research professor and also a Ph.D. advisor in the <a href="http://dase.ecnu.edu.cn" target="_blank">School of Data Science and Engineering</a> at <a href="http://english.ecnu.edu.cn" target="_blank">East China Normal University</a>, leading the PLANING lab (graPh mining and LANguage processING ☺). Before that, I received my Ph.D. degree from <a href="http://www.hku.hk/" target="_blank">The University of Hong Kong</a> in 2018, 
M.Eng. degree from <a href="http://www.ustc.edu.cn/">University of Science and Technology of China</a> in 2014 and B.Eng. degree from <a href="http://www.ncu.edu.cn/">Nanchang University</a> in 2011, respectively. Previously, I worked as a research scientist in the [Data Science Lab](https://datascience.jd.com) at JD.com from Aug 2018 to July 2019 and a postdoc researcher in <a href="http://www.hku.hk/" target="_blank">The University of Hong Kong</a> from July 2019 to Dec 2020.
I was also lucky to visit [Microsoft Research Asia, Shanghai](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/shanghai-ai-ml-group/) from Dec. 2021 to March 2022, and [Baidu Search BU](https://www.baidu.com/) from June to August 2023.

My general research interests focus on data mining and applied machine learning, in particular, on graph mining, semi-supervised learning and part of NLP related tasks. Generally speaking, I have spent lots of efforts in classification, clustering, link prediction and other generative tasks in graphs. Moreover, I like to explore some misc problems of challenge, such as reinforcement learning, crowdsourcing and NLP techniques. Specifically, my research interests include:
- **Machine learning**: semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning, weakly-supervised learning, graph-based learning;
- **Data mining**: graph neural networks, heterogeneous graph mining, OOD generalizability;
- **Language processing**: large language models (LLMs), code representation learning, prompt tuning;
- **Data privacy**: federated learning, data heterogeneity, model heterogeneity.

<!-- I am an incoming Ph.D. student at [HKU CS](https://www.cs.hku.hk/). Currently, I am working at the NLP group of [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) under the supervision of [Dr. Zhiyong Wu](https://lividwo.github.io/zywu.github.io/), focusing on topics related to LLM Agents. Previously, I was a master’s student at NUS, advised by [Dr. Xiaoli Li](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r/about-i2r/i2r-management/li-xiaoli) at the Institute for Infocomm Research ([I<sup>2</sup>R](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r)), A*STAR. Before that, I completed my B.Eng with distinction in the School of Data Science and Engineering ([DaSE](http://dase.ecnu.edu.cn/)) at East China Normal University, where I was privileged to be instructed by [Prof. Weining Qian](http://dase.ecnu.edu.cn/dase-module-gateway/dase/teacher/single_teacher.html?teacherId=27), [Prof. Xuesong Lu](http://dase.ecnu.edu.cn/dase-module-gateway/dase/teacher/single_teacher.html?teacherId=40), and [Prof. Xiang Li](https://lixiang3776.github.io/) for research and engineering projects. -->

<!-- My research interests include neural code intelligence, LLM-based agents, and broad deep learning topics in general. -->

<!-- I will start my Ph.D. in Computer Science at [HKU CS](https://www.cs.hku.hk/) in 2024 Fall 🐱 -->
